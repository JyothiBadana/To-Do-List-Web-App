# To-Do-List-Web-App
Create a simple front-end To-Do List app using vanilla JavaScript. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks complete instantly. Use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JS to handle dynamic task creation, completion toggling, and removal. The app updates UI without page reloads for smooth interaction.
